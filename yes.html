           <span class="span">Dear Rogell my love</span> ,<br>
            
            I wanted to take a moment to express my feelings for you in writing, as sometimes the deepest emotions are best captured through words on paper.
            
            From the moment you entered my life, you've brought so much joy, laughter, and love. I cherish every moment we spend together, from our biggest adventures to our quietest evenings. Your smile brightens my darkest days, and your support gives me strength when I need it most.
            
            What I love most about you is how easy you make it for me to trust you and how naturally it happens, the more i get to know you, you just remind me that i have someone to have faith in and who will have faith in me, we complete each other, you don't give me your love expecting to be loved back in return you don't look back for anything in return and I've learned that's what this love means to me I'm not looking for anything in return when i say i love you when i do things to show that i love you, this is how i know that this is a genuine and real and true love. The way you that you care enough to ask me about my day after you've had a long day, the way that you makes sure to ask me about me and you don't forget the details in the things i have expressed to you, the way you don't mention conversations that was hard for me to have or bring them back up when we have disagreements to make me feel bad, the way that every time you'd done something to hurt me and you said you will change it wasn't just empty promises but you follow through on your word makes me fall in love with you more each day. You've helped me grow in ways I never imagined possible, and I'm grateful for your presence in my life.
            
            i admire a lot about you since i met you i knew you were very intelligent but you've opened up more to me about how smart you actually are but its not about you being smart and emotionally intelligent, its about how much you love your job, how much you love helping others and how easy you make it look to help someone no matter who they are. you are really someone i never would've taken to be emotional but that side of you made me feel so seen, and so loved to know that you aren't just a robot or machine to get things done, you put the effort into this relationship, you make sure i am okay and for that i appreciate you. 
            
            i love you for giving me a chance to be more of myself with you, i love you for showing me that there's always a benefit in looking at the good in people, you make me believe again that not everyone are bad, you definitely are the best. 
            
            Our journey together has been beautiful, and I look forward to creating more memories with you. You mean the world to me, and I want you to know that my love for you grows stronger with each passing day.
            
            Thank you for being you, for loving me, and for making my life more beautiful than I ever dreamed possible.
            
            With all my love,
